# Pwnagotchi

Pwnagotchi is an A2C-based “AI” powered by bettercap and running on a Raspberry Pi Zero W that learns from its surrounding WiFi environment in order to maximize the crackable WPA key material it captures (either by passive scanning or active deauthentication). This material is collected as PCAP files containing any form of handshake supported by hashcat, including PMKIDs, full and half WPA handshakes.

The purpose of this device is to give (ethical) hackers an excuse to learn about reinforcement learning and WiFi networking, also to give us a reason to get out for more walks.


The more you use this virtual pet, better and faster it gets at capturing handshakes and getting pcap files.

Disclaimer: This tool is created for educational purposes only, cracking and revealing network passwords can and probably will give birth to many unpleasant results for you dear reader. Be conscious and use your pet for good.

The purpose of this device is to give (ethical) hackers an excuse to learn about reinforcement learning, WiFi networking and reconnaissance and handshake processes, also to give us a reason to get out for more walks and socialize :)

The more we use our virtual pet, better and faster furthermore more efficient it gets at capturing handshakes and getting pcap files. Your device will keep on learning with you to optimize it’s efficiency.

I suggest you to search more about the plugins and check the original Pwnagotchi repository to find more information about them. That way you can customize your Pwnagotchi the way you want. Enable and disable plugins to see which ones are more efficient and suit you the most. More you understand how the device and it’s plugins work, you will use it more efficiently and have more fun while doing so.





I will add more plugins of my own and write their description on the MyPlugins.txt file
